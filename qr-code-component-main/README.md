## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Basic concepts of HTML Semantics, Flexbox and Media Queries.
- Refering to Figma Design
- Setting up Git and GitHub repositories
- Writing markdown for README.md files
- Deploying project on Github Pages

## HTML report - errors/warnings resolved

- Consider using the "h1" element as a top-level heading only (all "h1" elements are treated as top-level headings by many screen readers and other tools).

- Section lacks heading. Consider using "h2"-"h6" elements to add identifying headings to all sections.


### Continued development

Need more hands on practice on Flexbox implementation
