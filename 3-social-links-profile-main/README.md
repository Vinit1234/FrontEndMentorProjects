## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Use of flex can be optimised. Use it only where necessary.

- Organising CSS in sections.
- `<nav>` can be inside `<main>` if it is specific to `<main>` section only.
- Apply hovering effect on `<a>` rather than `<li>` in navigation.


### Useful resources

- [Nav can be inside main](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22549766/should-a-nav-tag-be-outside-the-main-tag) - This helped me for understanding that navigation ( which is specific to main tag ) can be put within main itself.
- [Navigation hover changes nav-link color](https://codepen.io/maheshambure21/pen/QwXaRw) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand to add hover effects on `<a>` tag instead of `<link>` tag.
