## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Parcel


### What I learned

With this project, I gained in-depth knowledge on implementation of complex responsive layouts using flex, grid and their properties along with media queries.

I also got an opportunity to implement mixins in SASS using Parcel.

The task of adding a quote image in background using position property added an addition challenge and it was fun.

### Continued development

I will learn more about SASS project structure to achieve modularity using partials and other concepts.
