## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow- For styles

### What I learned

- I learned how to implement SASS in the project using Parcel. See the Notes folder for parcel-scripts.

- For just compiling SASS w/o Parcel run the following:
```
> npm install sass -D
> sass --watch scss/styles.scss css/styles.css
```

### Continued development

- Work more on Responsive images and SASS.
- Try to learn and implement Tailwind CSS.
- Explore more about using FireFox Page Inspector.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - This helped me for exploring the concepts of SASS.
- [Responsive Images](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images) - This proved to be a crucial resource for learning to make images responsive.
