Ideas to test yourself

1. Focus on writing semantic HTML and using the correct elements based on the content.
2. Train your eye for detail by getting your solution to look similar to the design.
3. The font sizes in this project are slightly smaller in the mobile layout. Find a way to reduce font size for smaller screens without using media queries.
