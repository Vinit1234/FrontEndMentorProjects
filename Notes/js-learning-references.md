## Learning References:

Aside from that, there are some great forums where someone has probably already asked the question you need to know the answer to. If you haven't already, we recommend you check the following:

  - [Stack Overflow:](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)  The OG developer forum. If you have a question about coding, the answer is probably already on here!

  - [SitePoint Forums:](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/) Very similar to Stack Overflow, but maintained by SitePoint, a tech education platform.

  - [freeCodeCamp:](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/javascript/421) freeCodeCamp also has a forum for help and support.
