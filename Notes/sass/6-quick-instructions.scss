Quick Instructions:

1. Each partial (like _variables.scss, _buttons.scss, etc.) should be inside its appropriate folder.

2. Your abstracts/index.scss should forward its contents like this:

// abstracts/index.scss
@forward 'variables';
@forward 'mixins';
@forward 'functions';

3. Ensure your build tool (like Dart Sass, Vite, Webpack, etc.) supports @use/@forwardâ€”Dart Sass is recommended.
