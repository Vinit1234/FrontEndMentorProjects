Your modular SASS structure is well-organized and follows solid conventions. 
Here are a few suggestions to make it even better:

1. Partial Naming Consistency: Consider prefixing partials with underscores in comments
 to match actual filenames, 
 e.g., // _variables.scss instead of // Directory: abstracts/_variables.scss.

2. Use of @forward and @use: Instead of traditional @import, 
structure modules using SASS's modern @use and @forward system. For example:

a. In abstracts/index.scss, use:

@forward 'variables';
@forward 'mixins';

b. Then in your main main.scss:
@use 'abstracts' as *;


3. Extend Reusable Styles: Components like .btn--primary and .btn--secondary 
could extend a base button style using @extend to avoid redundancy.

4. Split Media Queries by Component (Optional Advanced Tip): To reduce style scattering,
 you can colocate media queries with their respective component styles instead of placing them all in utils.
